- PDB support
- path normalization (for file/line vis and file jump)
- 'guard variable for', 'vtable for', 'non-virtual thunk to' are usually useful as suffixes - grouping option? (ideally need to xform symbol names here)
- autosave/load UI settings to config file
- refactor some code with wpf bindings
- better async wpf helpers
- set/reset root for treeview
- add support for external editors (vs/vim/emacs/notepad++/...?)
- fix binutils parsing of dwarf decodedline for some elf files (addr2line works but objdump fails)
- internal editor can display size per line in an extra column?..
