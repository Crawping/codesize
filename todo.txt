grouping details:
- 'guard variable for', 'vtable for', 'non-virtual thunk to' are usually useful as suffixes - grouping option? (ideally need to xform symbol names here)
- even if word prefix is selected, it may make sense to complete prefix names letter by letter? (i.e. D3DCreateDevice vs D3DXCreateTexture)

ui responsiveness:
- loading panel should pop up when we compute symbols/filelines
- faster filtering (cache individual parts, only recompute what is affected by UI changes? esp. applicable to FileLine grouping)
- async treeview group expansion (async binding + custom styling to indicate that node contents is being computed)

editor:
- copy full path, open folder
- add support for external editors (vs/vim/emacs/notepad++/...?)
- internal editor can display size per line in an extra column

other features:
- set/reset root for treeview
- "file has changed, reload?" popup panel
- diff between two files (need to figure out sorting criteria and to ensure that we don't keep two full datasets in memory)
